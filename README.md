# Student Management System

A MongoDB-based system to manage student records, courses, and enrollments. This project allows administrators and instructors to efficiently handle student information, course details, grades, and enrollments.

## Overview

The **Student Management System** is a backend application built using **MongoDB** as the database. It is designed to store and manage the following data:
- **Student Information**: Names, emails, and other personal details.
- **Courses**: Course names, IDs, durations, and descriptions.
- **Enrollments**: Student enrollment in various courses, along with grades.

This project helps demonstrate basic MongoDB CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and provides a simple interface to interact with the data.

## Features

- Add, update, and delete student records.
- Add and manage courses.
- Track student enrollment in courses.
- Update and manage grades for enrolled students.
- Query student and course data using MongoDBâ€™s aggregation and lookup features.

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing student and course data.
- **JavaScript**: Programming language for both backend or frontend.


### Prerequisites

1. **Install MongoDB**: You need to have MongoDB installed compass and use MongoDB Shell.
   - For local installation, follow the official guide: [Install MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/).
   - Alternatively, set up a free MongoDB cluster on [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/StudentManagementSystem.git
cd StudentManagementSystem
```
